# Introduction

This is a simply website to show my capabilities of working with the "tools" Bootstrap 5, JavaScript(JS), HTML and CSS. <br>
Goal of this project was to create a website via Bootstrap and JS that interacts with an API, in this case the "TheMealDB". <br>
I specifically only used example Code Snippets from the Bootstrap 5 documentation.

All Progress is tracked in this git repository.
